\chapter{Noise generation and noise reduction}

\section{Problem statement}

In this problem, you are required to write a program to generate different types
of random noises started from the Uniform noise and Gaussian noise. \\
And then add some of these noises to the circuit image and investigate the different
mean filters and order statistics as the textbook did at pages 344-352.
