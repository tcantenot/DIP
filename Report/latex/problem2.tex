\chapter{Combining spatial enhancement methods}

\section{Problem statement}

Implement the image enhancement task of Section 3.7 (Fig 3.43) (Section 3.8, Fig 3.46 in our slides).\\
The image to be enhanced is \textit{skeleton\_orig.tif}.\\
You should implement all steps in Figure 3.43. \\
(You cannot directly use functions of Matlab such as imfilter or fspecial,
implement all functions by yourself).

\section{Python program}

Usage:~\textbf{python problem2.py [-h] [--laplacian] [--sobel] [-a A] image\_path}

For example, to use and display the results of applying a 3x3 laplacian filter with A = 1.7, type:
\textbf{python problem2.py --laplacian -a 1.7 skeleton_orig.tif}
